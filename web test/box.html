    Not only do I like the nature of the <a href="https://en.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> Spanish lessons, but I also like that the lessons are short and engaging. They just go by super quick. This is great for busy professionals and students. Not everyone out there has a spare hour everyday to dedicate to their language learning.
